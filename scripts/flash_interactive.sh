# ============================================================================
# Author: Arkadiusz Kubiak
# LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arkadiusz-kubiak-1b4994150
# Purpose: Interactive Android .img flashing tool for Khadas VIM4
# Version: 2.0 - Enhanced with comprehensive comments and documentation
# Created: 2025
# 
# Description:
# This script provides an interactive interface for flashing Android image files
# to the Khadas VIM4 development board. It supports both fastboot and fastbootd
# modes, handles A/B partitions, dynamic partitions, and provides comprehensive
# diagnostics to help users understand their device's partition layout.
#
# Key Features:
# ‚úÖ Interactive file selection with intelligent presets
# ‚úÖ Automatic detection of required fastboot mode (fastboot vs fastbootd)
# ‚úÖ Comprehensive bootloader unlock verification
# ‚úÖ Detailed partition diagnostics and device information
# ‚úÖ Color-coded output with emojis for enhanced user experience
# ‚úÖ Robust error handling with detailed troubleshooting guidance
# ‚úÖ Support for dynamic partitions (super.img)
# ‚úÖ Compatibility with various Bash versions (no associative arrays)
# ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging and progress feedback
#
# Usage Examples:
# --------------
# Basic usage (run from directory containing .img files):
#   ./flash_interactive.sh
#
# Run diagnostics first (recommended for new users):
#   ./flash_interactive.sh  # Choose option 6 for diagnostics
#
# Quick essential flash:
#   ./flash_interactive.sh  # Choose option 1 for essential only
#
# Prerequisites:
# -------------
# üîß CRITICAL: Unlocked bootloader (see docs/VIM4_partitions.md)
# üîß Android platform tools (adb, fastboot) installed and in PATH
# üîß USB debugging enabled on device (for ADB method)
# üîß Appropriate .img files in the project directory
# üîß Reliable USB connection and proper drivers
#
# Safety Notes:
# ------------
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Always unlock bootloader BEFORE running this script
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Flashing wrong images can brick your device
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  userdata.img will erase all user data (script will ask for confirmation)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Ensure stable power and USB connection during flashing
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Have recovery method ready (UART access, recovery images)
#
# Troubleshooting:
# ---------------
# üîç Use diagnostics option (6) to understand your device
# üîç Check bootloader unlock status if flashing fails
# üîç Verify .img files are in correct directory
# üîç Try different USB cable/port if connection issues
# üîç See docs/VIM4_partitions.md for detailed instructions
# ============================================================================

# Enable strict error handling - script will exit immediately on any command failure
# This prevents partial flashing and ensures script stops at first sign of trouble
set -e

# OUTPUT STYLING AND EMOJI FUNCTIONS
# ============================================================================
# This section defines consistent color schemes and emoji-enhanced output
# functions for better user experience and visual feedback.
# All color codes use ANSI escape sequences for terminal compatibility.
# ============================================================================

# ANSI Color Codes - simplified and more readable color scheme
readonly RED='\033[0;31m'      # Errors only
readonly GREEN='\033[0;32m'    # Success messages only
readonly YELLOW='\033[0;33m'   # Warnings only
readonly BLUE='\033[0;34m'     # Headers only
readonly WHITE='\033[0;37m'    # Normal info (no color for most text)
readonly BOLD='\033[1m'        # Important text
readonly NC='\033[0m'          # No Color - reset to default

# ============================================================================
# Simplified Output Functions - Less Colorful, More Readable
# ============================================================================
# Reduced emoji usage and simplified color scheme for better readability
# Focus on clear hierarchy: errors=red, success=green, warnings=yellow, headers=blue
# ============================================================================

# BOOTLOADER UNLOCK REQUIREMENTS
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: BOOTLOADER MUST BE UNLOCKED BEFORE FLASHING
# =======================================================
# Before using this script, you MUST unlock the bootloader on your Khadas VIM4.
# This requires a USB-TTL converter and serial connection to the device.
# 
# For detailed bootloader unlock instructions, see:
# docs/VIM4_partitions.md - Section: "Khadas VIM4 Bootloader Unlock"
# 
# Quick summary:
# 1. Connect USB-TTL converter to VIM4 GPIO pins (GND, TX, RX)
# 2. Use serial terminal with 921600 baud rate
# 3. Enter U-Boot console during boot
# 4. Run commands:
#    kvim4# setenv lock 0
#    kvim4# setenv avb2 0
#    kvim4# saveenv
#    kvim4# reset
# 
# WARNING: Using this script on a locked bootloader will result in errors!
# =======================================================

# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Configure project directory - change this path as needed
# Leave empty to use script's location automatically
# This should point to your Android build output directory containing .img files

# FLASHING OPERATIONS - CORE FUNCTIONALITY
# ============================================================================
# This section contains the main flashing logic that handles the actual
# partition writing process. It automatically manages fastboot mode switching
# and provides detailed progress feedback throughout the operation.
#
# Key Features:
# - Automatic mode detection and switching (fastboot vs fastbootd)
# - Two-phase flashing process for different partition types
# - Special handling for verification metadata (vbmeta)
# - User confirmation for data-destructive operations
# - Comprehensive error handling and progress reporting
# ============================================================================

# Main flashing orchestration function
# ====================================
# This function coordinates the entire flashing process by:
# 1. Categorizing files by required fastboot mode
# 2. Flashing bootloader-mode files first
# 3. Switching to fastbootd mode for dynamic partitions
# 4. Handling special cases (vbmeta, userdata)
# 5. Providing detailed progress and status updates

# ============================================================================
# MAIN SCRIPT EXECUTION AND WORKFLOW
# ============================================================================
# This section orchestrates the entire flashing process through a logical
# workflow that ensures safety, provides clear feedback, and handles errors.
#
# SCRIPT WORKFLOW (Version 2.1):
# 1. Initialize and display welcome message
# 2. Enter main menu loop with options:
#    a. Flash Android Images - Complete interactive flashing process
#    b. Partition Diagnostics - Device info and partition analysis  
#    c. Show Documentation - Display key documentation sections
#    d. Exit - Clean script termination
# 3. For flashing option:
#    ‚Ä¢ Prepare device (ADB detection -> fastboot modes -> unlock verification)
#    ‚Ä¢ Scan for available image files in project directory
#    ‚Ä¢ Present user-friendly preset menu with detailed descriptions
#    ‚Ä¢ Process user selection and validate file availability
#    ‚Ä¢ Show final confirmation with selected files and descriptions
#    ‚Ä¢ Execute flashing operations with automatic mode switching
#    ‚Ä¢ Finalize with device reboot and success confirmation
#    ‚Ä¢ Return to main menu for additional operations
# 4. Menu loop continues until user chooses to exit
#
# ERROR HANDLING:
# - Exits gracefully on any critical error (bootloader locked, no files, etc.)
# - Provides detailed troubleshooting information for common issues
# - Validates each step before proceeding to prevent partial flashing
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
# - Bootloader unlock verification before any flashing
# - User confirmation before actual flashing begins
# - Automatic fastboot mode switching for different partition types
# - Clear indication of what will be flashed and potential data loss
