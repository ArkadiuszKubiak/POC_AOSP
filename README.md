## Component Overview

### 1. Kernel Driver

- **Path:** `kernel/common/drivers/char/hello_world_driver.c`
- **Description:** Implements a simple character driver that creates a sysfs entry `/sys/kernel/hello_world/hello`. Messages sent from user space are logged in the kernel log.  
    **Note:** This file should be modified to match the source requirements for the AOSP kernel, not the AOSP user space itself.

### 2. HAL Service

- **Path:** `vendor/brcm/interfaces/helloworld/default/`
- **Description:** Implements the AIDL HAL service (`vendor.brcm.helloworld-service`). It receives messages from clients and writes them to the kernel driver via sysfs.

### 3. AIDL Interface

- **Path:** `vendor/brcm/interfaces/helloworld/aidl/vendor/brcm/helloworld/IHelloWorld.aidl`
- **Description:** Defines the AIDL interface for communication between the Android app and the HAL service.

### 4. Android Application

- **Path:** `vendor/brcm/apps/HelloWorld/`
- **Description:** Privileged Android app with a simple UI to send messages to the HAL service. Uses JNI to communicate with the HAL.

### 5. SELinux Policy

- **Path:** `device/brcm/rpi4/sepolicy/`
- **Description:** SELinux type enforcement and file contexts for the HAL service.

### 6. Device Makefile

- **Path:** `device/brcm/rpi4/device.mk`
- **Description:** Adds the HAL service and HelloWorld app to the build (`PRODUCT_PACKAGES += vendor.brcm.helloworld-service HelloWorld`).

## How to Integrate and Run

**Integration Steps Across Two Projects: AOSP Android 14 and AOSP Kernel**

1. **Copy Files:** Place the relevant files and directories into the appropriate locations in two separate repositories: the AOSP Android 14 source tree for rbpi4 and the AOSP Kernel source tree, following the structure described above.
2. **Kernel Driver:** Add `hello_world_driver.c` to the AOSP Kernel repository and update the corresponding `Makefile` to include the new driver in the kernel build process.
3. **Build Kernel:** Compile the kernel with the new driver and generate a bootable kernel image.
4. **Build AOSP:** Configure and build the Android 14 system (`lunch`, `make`, etc.), ensuring that the HAL service, application, and SELinux policies are included in the build configuration.
5. **Flash Images:** Flash both the system image and the kernel image onto the Raspberry Pi 4 device.
6. **Test:** Launch the `HelloWorld` application on the device, send a message, and verify the kernel log to confirm correct communication between the app, HAL service, and kernel driver.

*Note: This workflow requires coordination between the AOSP Android 14 and AOSP Kernel projects. Changes to the kernel driver must be made in the kernel repository, while user space components (HAL, app, SELinux policies) are managed in the AOSP Android 14 repository.*

## Notes

- This example is for educational and prototyping purposes.
- SELinux policies are minimal and should be reviewed for production use.
- The structure is designed for easy integration with AOSP 14 for rbpi4.
