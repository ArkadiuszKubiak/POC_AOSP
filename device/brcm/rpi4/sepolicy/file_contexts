#Hello_world
# This entry assigns a SELinux security context to the Broadcom HelloWorld HAL service executable.
# The path '/vendor/bin/hw/vendor.brcm.helloworld-service' is matched using a regular expression.
# The label 'u:object_r:hal_brcm_hellowordservice_exec:s0' specifies:
#   - 'u' (user): The SELinux user, typically 'u' for system processes.
#   - 'object_r' (role): The object role, indicating this is a file or resource.
#   - 'hal_brcm_hellowordservice_exec' (type): The SELinux type for the HelloWorld HAL executable.
#   - 's0' (level): The MLS/MCS security level, usually 's0' for Android.
# This context ensures that when the service is executed, SELinux applies the correct access controls,
# isolating the process and restricting its permissions according to the policy for hardware services.
# Proper labeling is essential for enforcing security boundaries and protecting the system from unauthorized access.
