# This init.rc service definition starts the Broadcom HelloWorld HAL service.
# - The service executable is located at /vendor/bin/hw/vendor.brcm.helloworld-service.

service vendor.brcm.helloworld-service /vendor/bin/hw/vendor.brcm.helloworld-service
# - It runs in the 'hal' class, which is typically used for hardware abstraction layer services.
    class hal
# - The service exposes the AIDL interface aidl.vendor.brcm.helloworld.IHelloWorld at the 'default' instance.
#   This directive registers the service implementation with Android's service manager,
#   making it discoverable and accessible to clients via the specified AIDL interface.
#   The 'default' instance name allows clients to connect using the standard service lookup.
#   This enables inter-process communication (IPC) between apps and the HAL service,
#   facilitating requests and responses as defined in the IHelloWorld interface.
    interface aidl aidl.vendor.brcm.helloworld.IHelloWorld/default
# - The service runs as the 'root' user and group.
    user root
    group root
# - SELinux context is set to 'u:r:hal_brcm_hellowordservice:s0' for proper security labeling.
#   When the service is started by Android's init system, the 'seclabel' directive ensures
#   that the process runs in the 'hal_brcm_hellowordservice' SELinux domain, regardless of the file label.
#   This type transition occurs only when init launches the service, allowing SELinux to enforce
#   specific security policies for this process. The process label controls what the service can access
#   and how it interacts with other components, providing isolation and protection according to SELinux rules.
    seclabel u:r:hal_brcm_hellowordservice:s0
